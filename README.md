## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Continued development

Since the time I finished this project I wanted to take a look at my code and see what I could improve, I think my way of writing HTML and CSS could be more organized, I have since then looked at the BEM method for writing classes to improve specificity and overall making my code look more organized with the help of Sass and BEM together. I have also now looked more into switching from the import rule to use and forward rules in sass, which are better practices.
